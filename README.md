# Icon Construct
***Icon Construct*** is a very simple tool mod designed for Icon Creators which allows you to Edit and Preview on real time Sprite Offsets for your icons!

This mod is meant to be used alongside the More Icons mod, more specifically, its Icon Editor feature. You create the icon first using MoreIcons, then edit the offsets to your liking with Icon Construct. Simple! Therefore, this mod will **only work with MoreIcons added icons, and not with vanilla icons.** 
You can use MoreIcons' "Load from Traditional Icon Packs" setting to load your traditional icons via the mod and use them here, though!

To get started, simply click on the new button added to the Icon Garage, it'll look similar to the mod's logo. This button will open up the Mod's **Icon Workbench** popup from where u can start working with ur icons immediately!

## Mod Features
The mod has various general utilities for Icon Creators, such as:

- **Easy editing and Live Preview of Icon Sprite Offsets**: Quickly edit and preview Sprite Offsets for every individual Sprite of whichever icon you're working on! No need to reload the game for every minuscule .5 change to Offsets only to see it doesn't look like u wanted it to!
- **Automatic Plist Editing**: Once you've tweaked all the Offsets you needed to, simply click on the *"Apply"* button and let the mod automatically apply your changes to your icon's Plist file! After that, all of your changes are saved! *(This feature saves a backup of your plist before editing your main file)*
- **Ball Rolling Preview**: Quickly preview how your Ball icons are gonna look in-game directly in the mod's Popup! In case you're worried if the circle at the middle is gonna be painful to look at when spinning because of it not being properly centered. Allows for controlling the ball's rotation speed too!
- **Preview Cube Position**: Preview how the Cube will look like when riding your Ship, UFO and Jetpack Icons! Allows for tweaking the cube's opacity, in case u want to see where it'll be, but want it to be transparent for whatever reason.
- **Preview Robot/Spider Animations**: Quickly preview how any of the available animations are gonna look on your brand new Robot/Spider Icons! All animations are available to test and see directly from the mod's popup.
- **Gameplay-Accurate Hitbox Preview**: Wanna check if your icons are too big/too small relative to the game's hitbox? Toggle the Hitbox Preview on and see if there's anything you need to adjust!
- **Quick Color Changing**: Too lazy to press ESC and do a few clicks to change your colors? That's okay, you can change the Preview Icon's colors directly from the Popup! And you're not even limited to the game's selection of colors, you've got full RGB & Hex Codes Support!
- **Icon Renderer**: Once your icon's done, if you wanna show it off to the people quickly, you can click on the top left's *Camera Button* and immediately render your icon into a PNG image! Inside the mod's settings you can customize the folder your Renders are saved onto, as well as the background color your renders have! (If you want them to have one)
- **Quick Addition/Substraction to Offsets**: Want to move your entire icon 7 pixels up, but all your offsets are all over the place and all of them are different? Are u as bad at math as the creator of this mod and can't spend a solid minute calculating what number to set? No problem! Clicking the little "+" buttons located next to the Text Inputs will open a small popup where you can input any number, positive or negative, and it'll add that number to the chosen offset!

## Recommended mods
Some recommended mods to use alongside Icon Construct are the following:

- More Icons: Mandatory for the mod to work.
- Better Touch Prio: Could fix any Touch Priority issues in the mod's popup if "Update On Text Change" is enabled. (AKA, fixes still being able to interact with the Garage behind the mod's popup.)
- Scroll Inputs: Could help adjust offsets easier by using the mouse wheel to increase/decrease the offsets for Icon Parts, instead of having to type in the values manually.
